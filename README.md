## What is Skytable?

Skytable is an effort to provide the best of key/value stores, document stores and columnar databases, that is, **simplicity, flexibility and queryability at scale**. The name 'Skytable' exemplifies our vision to create a database that has limitless possibilities. Skytable was previously known as TerrabaseDB (and then Skybase) and is also nicknamed "STable", "Sky" and "SDB" by the community.

Skytable is curently under development, but can be used as a **performant**, **secure** and **persistent key-value store**.

## Getting started üöÄ

1. Download a bundle for your platform from [here ‚¨áÔ∏è ](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases)
2. Unzip the bundle
3. Make the files executable (run `chmod +x skyd skysh` on \*nix systems)
4. First run `skyd` to start the database server and then run `skysh` to start the interactive shell
5. Run commands like: `SET foo bar` , `GET bar` , `UPDATE cat mitten` or `DEL proprietary` on `skysh`!

You can learn more about installation [here](https://docs.skytable.io/getting-started/)

## Features

- **Insanely fast**: Scale to millions of queries per second per node
- **Multiple keyspaces/tables**: Seamlessly integrates with actions to provide a SQL-like experience
- **Key/value store**: `GET` , `SET` , `UPDATE` and [all that stuff](https://docs.skytable.io/actions-overview). With the `str` and `binstr` types.
- **Volatile tables**: For all the caching you need
- **Snapshots**: Automated (and tunable) snapshots for stress-free backups
- **Secure**: Secure connections are built into Skytable with SSL/TLS
- **Multithreaded**: Designed to exploit all CPU cores
- **Resource friendly**: The database server doesn't need more than 1MB to run
- **Convenient**: Without the setup hassle and system-specific dependencies

**üõ£Ô∏è There's a lot more coming! View our [roadmap](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/203)**

## Clients üîå

The project currently maintains an official [Rust driver](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust) and we have plans
to support more languages along the way!
We also maintain a list of [community supported drivers here](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/wiki/Drivers).

If you want to use a different language, for now you'll just need to implement the simple and performant [Skyhash Protocol](https://docs.skytable.io/protocol/skyhash).
