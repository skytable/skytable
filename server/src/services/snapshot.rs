/// the interval for snapshotting expires or elapses, we create a snapshot. The snapshot service
/// keeps creating snapshots, as long as the database keeps running. Once [`dbnet::run`] broadcasts
/// a termination signal, we're ready to quit. This function will, by default, poison the database
/// if snapshotting fails, unless customized by the user.
