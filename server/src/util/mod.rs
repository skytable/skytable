/// When it's hard to have a _split mutable borrow_, all across the source we use custom
/// fat pointers which are inherently unbounded in their lifetime; this is needed in cases where
/// it's **impossible** to do so. But when you can _somehow_ bind a lifetime without causing
/// a compiler error, it is always good to do so to avoid misuse of the previously mentioned
/// fat pointers. This is exactly what this type does. It binds a context-dependent lifetime
/// to some type which preferably has no other lifetime (something like an `UnsafeSlice`, for
/// example).
///
/// How do you access this? Always consider using [`AsRef::as_ref`] to get a ref to the inner
/// type and then do whatever you like. Move semantics to the inner type are prohibited (and
/// marked unsafe)

/// ## Important notes
/// - lifetimes are context captured by the compiler. so if this doesn't work, we'll need
/// to explicitly annotate bounds
