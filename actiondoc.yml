- name: SDEL
  complexity: O(n)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [SDEL <key1> <key2> ...]
  desc: |
    Delete all keys if all of the keys exist in the current table. Do note that if a single key doesn't
    exist, then a `Nil` code is returned.

  complexity: O(n)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [SUPDATE <key1> <value1> <key2> <value2> ...]

- name: MKSNAP
  complexity: O(n)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [MKSNAP <SNAPNAME>]
  desc: |
    This action can be used to create a snapshot. Do note that this action# *requires
    snapshotting to be enabled on the server side**, before it can create snapshots.
    \nIf you want to create snapshots# *without** snapshots being enabled on the server-side,
    pass a second argument <SNAPNAME> to specify a snapshot name and a snapshot will
    be create in a folder called `remote` under your snapshots directory. \nFor more
    information on snapshots, read [this document](/snapshots)
  return: [Rcode 0, err-snapshot-disabled, err-snapshot-busy]
- name: LSKEYS
  complexity: O(n)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [LSKEYS <limit>, LSKEYS <entity>, LSKEYS <entity> <limit>]
  desc: |
    Returns a flat string array of keys present in the current table or in the provided entity.
    If no <limit> is given, then a maximum of 10 keys are returned. If a limit is specified,
    then a maximum of <limit> keys are returned. The order of keys is meaningless.
  return: [Typed Array]
- name: POP
  complexity: O(1)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [POP <key>]
  desc: Deletes and return the value of the provided key from the current table.
  return: [String, Binstr, Rcode 5]
- name: MPOP
  complexity: O(n)
  accept: AnyArray
  syntax: [POP <key1> <key2> ...]
  desc: |
    Deletes and returns the values of the provided keys from the current table. If the database is poisoned,
    this will return a server error. An exceptional scenario can arise when the database
    fails in-between removing all the keys. In that case, you get the server error
    response code instead of the keys. If the server recovers inbetween, then the
    appropriate values (if any) will be returned. In all other cases a NIL error is
    returned (code 1)
  return: [Flat Array]
