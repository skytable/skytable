      This action can be used to create a snapshot. Do note that this action **requires
      snapshotting to be enabled on the server side**, before it can create snapshots.
      If you want to create snapshots **without** snapshots being enabled on the server-side,
      pass a second argument `<SNAPNAME>` to specify a snapshot name and a snapshot will
      be create in a folder called `rsnap` under your data directory. For more
