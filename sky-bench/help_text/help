NOTES:
    - If no password is supplied, we look for the `{password_env_var}`
      environment variable
    - The user for auth will be 'root' since only 'root' accounts allow the
      creation and deletion of spaces and models
    - A space called 'bench' will be created
    - A model called 'bench' will be created in the space
      created above. The created model has the structure {un: string, pw: uint8}
    - The model and space will be removed once the benchmark is complete
