    argument
  - Even faster implementation, even for Skyhash 1.0
- New query language: BlueQL
  - `create keyspace` is now `create space`
  - `create table` is now `create model`

## Version 0.7.6

### Fixes

- Fixed erroneous removal of `auth` system table during tree cleanup (see #276)

## Version 0.7.5

### Additions

- `sys` action for system information and metrics:
  - `info`: For static properties:
    - `version`: Server version
    - `protocol`: Protocol version string (Skyhash-x.y)
    - `protover`: Protocol version float
  - `metric`: For dynamic properties:
    - `health`: System health
    - `storage`: Bytes used for on-disk storage
- `INSPECT KEYSPACE` without arguments to inspect the current keyspace
- `INSPECT TABLE` without arguments to inspect the current table
- `AUTH WHOAMI` returns the AuthID of the currently logged in user

### Improvements

- Enable multiples values to be pushed into a list at once with `lmod push`
- (skyd) Improved error reporting infrastructure with more details and context

### Fixes

- skysh:
  - Added error code output for new error codes which otherwise printed "Unknown error"
  - Fixed handling of EOF keystroke
- skyd:
  - Respect logging level for all terminal output
  - Fixed LF check in protocol impl
  - Fixed new instance detection (now checks if data directory is empty or not)
  - Fixed panic resulting from corrupted metadata in `PARTMAP`
  - Fixed invalid pipeline response when action error is propagated from a single stage
  - Fixed bug where the preload wasn't flushed if a snapshot already flushed it before the
    save on termination routine
  - Fixed bug that prevented tree cleanup from working
  - Disallow `PRELOAD` and `PARTMAP` as entity names
  - Fixed edge case where time on host is incorrect, resulting in bad snapshot names which might
    ultimately lead to loss of snapshot data
  - Fixed remote snapshots with same names being overwritten
- (sky-bench) Fixed `testkey` causing RSTs

## Version 0.7.4

### Additions

- Token-based authentication:
  - `auth claim`
  - `auth login <username> <token>`
  - `auth logout`
  - `auth adduser <username>`
  - `auth deluser <username>`
  - `auth restore <username>`
  - `auth restore <origin key> <username>`
  - `auth listuser`
- Shell now supports multiple `--eval` expressions
- Partial entity syntax: `:table` can be used for referring to the current table. For example
  you can use `use :default` instead of `use default:default`

### Fixes

- Fixed snapshot option being silently ignored in configuration file
- Fixed snapshot engine init failure

## Version 0.7.3

### Additions

- Added `dev/prod` mode for making sure that the recommended production settings are used
- Added support for system native endian storage (backward compatible)
- Added `range` to `lget` to get subarrays

### Fixes

- Fixed infinite wait (loop) when sample space for key generation is not large enough
- Fixed infinite save-on-termination loop. Now loop uses a threshold and on 4 subsequent `SIGINT` signals,
  it will quit forcefully
- Removed `upgrade` subcommand from `skyd` which was removed in 0.7, but was erroneously accepted in the CLI
  parameters
- Restored ability to use `--restore <backupdir>` to restore data from previous snapshots which was silently
  ignored

## Version 0.7.0

### Additions

- **Multiple keyspaces**:
  - Keyspaces hold multiple tables and determine the replication strategy
  - Keyspaces can be created with:
    ```sql
    CREATE KEYSPACE <name>
    ```
  - The `system` keyspace is reserved for the system while the `default` keyspace is
    the one available by default. The `system` or `default` keyspace cannot be removed
  - Keyspaces can be deleted with:
    ```sql
    DROP KEYSPACE <name>
    ```
  - If a keyspace still has tables, it cannot be dropped by using `DROP KEYSPACE <name>`, instead
    one needs to use `DROP KEYSPACE <name> force` to force drop the keyspace
- **Multiple tables**:
  - Tables hold the actual data. When you connect to the server, you are connected to the `default`
    table in the `default` keyspace. This table is non-removable
  - Tables can be created with:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE <entity> <model>(modelargs) <properties>
    ```
  - Tables can be dropped with:
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE <entity>
    ```
- **Entity groups**: While using DDL queries and inspection queries, we can use the _Fully Qualified Entity_ (FQE) syntax instead of the table name. For example, to `inspect` the `cyan` table in keyspace `supercyan`, one can simply run:
  ```sql
  INSPECT TABLE supercyan:cyan
  ```
  The syntax is:
  ```sql
  keyspace:table
  ```
  **Note**: Both keyspaces and tables are entities. The names of entities must:
  - Begin with an underscore (\_) or an ASCII alphabet
  - Not begin with a number (0-9)
  - Must have lesser than 64 characters
- **Keymap data model**:
  - To create a keymap table, run:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE <entity> keymap(<type>,<type>)
    ```
  - The following types were introduced:
    - `str`: A valid unicode string
    - `binstr`: A binary string
- **Volatile table property**:

  - To create a volatile table, irrespective of the data model, run:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE <entity> <model>(modelargs) volatile
    ```
  - Volatile tables always exist, but the data in them does not persist between restarts. This makes them extremely useful for caches

- **Inspection**:
  - Keyspaces can be inspected with:
    ```sql
    INSPECT KEYSPACE <name>
    ```
    This will list all the tables in the keyspace
  - Tables can be inspected with:
    ```sql
    INSPECT TABLE <entity>
    ```
    This will give information about the data model and other properties of the table
  - To list all keyspaces, this can be run:
    ```sql
    INSPECT KEYSPACES
    ```
- **Cyanstore 1A disk storage format**: Cyanstore (v1A) was a new storage format built for the multi-keyspace-table world. It efficiently stores and retrieves records, tables and keyspaces
- **Realtime keyspace/table switch**
  - To switch to a new keyspace in real-time, one needs to run:
    ```sql
    USE keyspace
    ```
  - To switch to a new table in real-time, one needs to run:
    ```sql
    USE keyspace:table
    ```
- **Entity respecting actions**:

  - **`FLUSHDB`**: To flush all the data in a specific table, run:
    ```sql
    FLUSHDB <entity>
    ```
  - **`DBSIZE`**: To see the number of entries in a specific table, run:
    ```sql
    DBSIZE <entity>
    ```
  - **`LSKEYS`**:
    - `LSKEYS` will return keys from the current table
    - `LSKEYS <count>` will return _count_ keys from the current table
    - `LSKEYS <entity>` will return keys from the given table
    - `LSKEYS <entity> <count>` will return _count_ keys from the given table

- **Snapshot isolation for strong actions**: This makes strong actions
  extremely reliable when compared to the earlier releases
- Non-interactive TLS private key passphrase input: Just save your password in some
  file and then pass `--tlspassin /path/to/passfile.txt`. You can do the same by using the
  `tlspassin` key under SSL in the configuration file
- `MPOP` now replaces `POP` to accept multiple keys while `POP` will accept a single key
  to follow the `MGET`/`GET` naming convention
- TLS port can now be set to a custom port via CLI arguments
- `sky-bench` can now run multiple times to get average values through the `--runs` option
- `HEYA` now does an echo with the second argument

### Fixes

- Zero length argument causing runtime panic in `skysh`
- `HEYA!` not reporting errors on incorrect number of arguments
- Panic on incorrect data type in `skyd`
- `sky-bench` no longer affects your personal data because it creates a random temporary table
  under the `default` keyspace
- `sky-bench`'s `testkey` subcommand causing key collisions
- Fix log output in `sky-bench` even if the `--json` flag was passed
- Use flocks to enable auto release of pid file, even if process is forcefully terminated
- Fixes [CVE-2021-37625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37625)

### Breaking

- All actions now accept the `AnyArray` type introduced in Skyhash 1.1
- `POP` now accepts one key while `MPOP` accepts multiple keys
- Disk storage format has changed
- The `upgrade` subcommand has been removed

### Upgrading existing clients

As Terrapipe 1.0 has reached EOL, all clients have to be upgraded to use the [Skyhash 1.0 Protocol](https://docs.skytable.io/protocol/skyhash).

### Upgrading existing datasets

Please refer to [this wiki article](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/wiki/Disk-storage-formats).

### Improvements in the new protocol (Skyhash)

- Upto 40% lower bandwidth requirements
- Upto 30% faster queries
- Support for recursive arrays
- More robust and well tested than Terrapipe

### Internal codebase improvements

- BGSAVE is now tested by the test suite
- `skysh` and `sky-bench` both use the [Rust client driver for Skytable](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust).

## Version 0.5.3 [2021-05-13]

> No breaking changes

Fix persistence (see [#150](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/150))

## Version 0.5.2 [2021-05-07]

> No breaking changes

- `sky-bench` is less agressive and runs sanity test before benchmarking
- `skyd` now locks the data file (the `data.bin` file)
- The data directory structure has been changed (see #144) (all files are now stored in ./data/\*)
- Fixed 'Connection Forcibly Closed' errors on Windows (see #110)
- Add support for line-editing and keyboard shortcuts on `skysh` (see #142)
- Fixed problems while parsing snapshots in the snapshot directory (see #144)
- The old data directory structure has been deprecated (see #144)

## Version 0.5.1 [2021-03-17]

> No breaking changes

- Built-in TLS/SSL support
- Custom host/port settings in `sky-bench`
- Mock keys can be created with `sky-bench`
- Security patch for VE/S/00001 [(CVE-2021-32814)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32814)
- Escaping for spaces in `skysh`
- `tdb` is now called `skyd` (short for 'Skytable Daemon')

## Version 0.5.0 [2020-11-19]

> This release introduces breaking changes!

- Command line configuration added to `tdb`
- ⚠ Positional arguments in `tsh` and `tdb-bench` have been removed
- `MKSNAP` now has an _enhanced version_ which enables snapshots to be created even if they're disabled on the server side
- If `BGSAVE` fails, no more writes will be accepted on the server side. All commands that try to modify data will return an internal server error
- `tdb-bench` now provides JSON output with the `--json` flag
- The `Dockerfile` was fixed to use command line arguments instead of the configuration file which caused problems
- The `enabled` key under the `snapshots` key in the configuration file has been removed

### Upgrading

- Users who ran `tsh` like `tsh 172.17.0.1 2003` will now need to run:

```shell
tsh -h 172.17.0.1 -p 2003
```

- Users who ran `tdb-bench` like `tdb-bench 10 100000 4` will now need to run:

```shell
tdb-bench -c 10 -q 100000 -s 4
```

- To enable snapshots, you just have to add the key: there is no need for the `enabled` key. To disable snapshots, you just have to omit the `snapshot` key (block) from your configuration file

## Version 0.4.5 [2020-10-29]

> No breaking changes

This release adds support for automated snapshots, while also adding the `MKSNAP` action for doing the same remotely.

## Version 0.4.4 [2020-10-03]

## Version 0.4.1 [2020-09-06]

> No breaking changes

This release adds support for configuration files

## Version 0.4.0 [2020-08-30]

> This release introduces breaking changes

Changes:

- Actions added: `MSET` , `MGET` , `MUPDATE`
- Terrapipe 1.0
- Improved terminal output

Fixes:

- Explicit handling for incomplete responses in `tsh`

### Migrating existing clients

The Terrapipe protocol was revised and promoted to 1.0. This will cause all existing client implementations to break, since the protocol has changed fundamentally. The clients have to implement the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/terrapipe).

## Version 0.3.2 [2020-08-07]

> No breaking changes

The `tsh` component printed the wrong version number. This has been fixed.

## Version 0.3.1 [2020-08-05]

> This release introduces breaking changes

This release fixes #7, #8. It also adds several under-the-hood optimizations greatly improving query performance.

### Migrating existing clients

The only significant change in the protocol is the new metalayout format: `#a#b#c` instead of the previously proposed `a#b#c#` .

### Disk storage format

The disk storage format was changed rendering existing binary data files incompatible. However, if you have any existing data - which is important, open an issue - because we'll be able to provide a tool that can help you easily migrate your existing datasets - with a one line command - so - no worries!

## Version 0.3.0 [2020-07-28] (⚠ EOL)

> No breaking changes.

This version enables persistence for stored data

## Version 0.2.0 [2020-07-27] (⚠ EOL)

> This release introduces breaking changes

This release implements the latest version of the Terrapipe protocol.

### Migrating existing clients

All clients have to reimplement the Terrapipe protocol to match the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/unsupported-tp).

## Version 0.1.0 [2020-07-17] (⚠ EOL)

This release provides an experimental client and server implementation.
